### Hey, I'm Raja Osama ðŸ‘‹.
A Rockstar programmer, Currently living in Dubai~UAE. I am a passionate developer that has successfully deployed and handed over more than 50+ mobile/desktop/Web applications.

I also have published two npm packages with over 800+ weekly downloads. I love programming, part of the reason is that I have been doing it since I was 12 years old; I have plenty of websites dating back to 2012 when I used to use blogger platforms and shared gaming-related content.

I am passionate about programming, and in the past six years, I have worked with many projects, frameworks, and languages. In my spare time, I am focused on building new applications or replicating some existing applications to understand the concept behind them, explore new frameworks, and write technical blogs about my experiences with technologies and guides on my medium profile.
