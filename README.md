### Hey, I'm Raja Osama 👋.
a multi-talented Human being, a self-proclaimed Best Developer in the world, A Javascript enthusiast, A Rockstar programmer, Currently living in Karachi~Pakistan. I have worked my ass off for the past 5 years in the tech world, mostly for startups and as a freelancer, created tons of landing pages, websites, mobile applications along the way, as well as dropped my bachelor's degree, failed my startup, and created huge, unrealistic expectations of self.

 “Expectations are the Thieves of Joy “  - Luke Winter  

The Abundant energy I have fuels me in the pursuit of various interests, hobbies, areas of studies, and artistic endeavors. I am a fast learner who adapts quickly to change and eager to learn new methods and procedures, whether it is a cultural change or a work-related one. 

“As for me, I am tormented with an everlasting itch for things remote. I love to sail forbidden seas, and land on barbarous coasts.” ― Herman Melville, Moby-Dick or, the Whale

 I am an adventurer, I want to travel the world, I am fascinated by the beauty of the Earth. The goal is to travel and to get me into a recursive infinite loop of traveling, living the moment and working in a location for a certain period and then move to the next one. Not just the world I am fascinated by SPACE, everything about space and distant planets and the countless stars fascinate me in a way that I can’t put into words.

 “to move, to breathe, to fly, to float, to gain while you give, to roam the roads of lands remote, to travel is to live.”  - Hans Christian Andersen.

 As a Programmer, I would like to call myself a Tech Agnostic Polyglot Programmer, One who can adapt and learn and change according to the surrounding, just like water. 

“Nothing is softer or more flexible than water, yet nothing can resist it.” – Lao Tzu
