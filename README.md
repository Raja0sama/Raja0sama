### Hey, I'm Raja Osama ðŸ‘‹.
a multi-talented Human being, A Javascript enthusiast, A Rockstar programmer, Currently living in Karachi~Pakistan. I have worked my ass off for the past 5 years in the tech world, mostly for startups and as a freelancer, created tons of landing pages, websites, mobile applications along the way, as well as dropped my bachelor's degree, failed my startup, and created huge, unrealistic expectations of self.


The Abundant energy I have fuels me in the pursuit of various interests, hobbies, areas of studies, and artistic endeavors. I am a fast learner who adapts quickly to change and eager to learn new methods and procedures, whether it is a cultural change or a work-related one. 


 I am an adventurer, I want to travel the world, I am fascinated by the beauty of the Earth. The goal is to travel and to get me into a recursive infinite loop of traveling, living the moment and working in a location for a certain period and then move to the next one. Not just the world I am fascinated by SPACE, everything about space and distant planets and the countless stars fascinate me in a way that I canâ€™t put into words.

 As a Programmer, I would like to call myself a Tech Agnostic Polyglot Programmer, One who can adapt and learn and change according to the surrounding.
